Let the viewer learn *about* you on the "About" section, where you can place information that you believe would help you stand out to others, whether personal or professional.<br><br>

> ### Experience
Display your *experience* in the "Experience" section, whether that be the different web development languages, design programs, and more via the application logo and title.<br><br>

> ### Projects
